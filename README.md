# movies-2
Author: Michael Spittler

This is a GitHub repository for part 2 of the Movies assignment in COSI 166b. 
The objective was to implement a similarity ranking system between two users given their lists of movie ratings,
and use these similarity rankings to create predictions on a user's rating of a given movie, which is then compared
to their actual rating of said movie.
